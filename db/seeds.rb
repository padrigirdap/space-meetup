# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   Person.create(first_name: 'Eric', last_name: 'Kelly')

# user = User.create(provider: "p", uid: "11", username: "user", email: "user@user.com", avatar_url: "test")
# user2 = User.create(provider: "o", uid: "33", username: "user2", email: "user2@user.com", avatar_url: "test2")
#
# meetup = Meetup.create(name: "an awful party", description: "y", location: "la")
